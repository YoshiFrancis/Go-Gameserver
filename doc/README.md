to tigger mouse click on the application,
i can use hx-trigger=Mousclick (whatevrer event it is)
then in the script tag, i can add event for htmx:wsConfigSend to show how to deliver the detail wanted

problem I will face is how to remove this script everytime the application disconnects.
I shall have to see 
  -- i do not think this to be a problem. I will just send over the index.html each time app is reset. Unless, I can find a way to delete
      script tags
