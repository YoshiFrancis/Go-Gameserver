# Example Application

### Description

- Application examples to showcase how to make an application for distributed go web server
- Will be using Go in particular due to the rest of the code base being in the Go language
- Will potentially make a C++ example as well
- Most languages should be able to be used as most langugaes provide support for socket programming 

- For an application to connect to a leader, you must somehow configure application to connect to the leader via the leader's ip
- Depending on how you settup the application server, the application can connect to 1 or more leaders concurrently

### AIM

- showcase how to make an application
- test my code

### Reqiurements

- Any language capable of utilizing network TCP (most languages fulfill this role)
- Use of HTMX (will be communicationg application changes via html)
